# RunningCalculator

## Overview
A console app which does simple add and subtract, showing the journal... like an old roll paper calculator would.
Intended for entering financial numbers.

## Installing the application

### Option A - Clone the code and load in Visual Studio Code (Windows, Mac or Linux)

Use the command `dotnet run` to start the application.

### Option B - Install a compiled binary for your platform (Windows or Linux)

Download the appropriate zip file for your operating system, and decompress it into a folder.

- `RunningCalculator-linux-arm.tgz` for Raspberry Pi
- `RunningCalculator-linux-x64.tgz` for Ubuntu/Debian Linux
- `RunningCalculator-win10-x64.zip` for Windows 10 64-bit

Note: This method does not require any .Net Core SDK or binaries, and is best for non-code writers.

## Operation
Enter one of the following, followed by ENTER:
- Positive number to add
- Negative number to subtract
- (nothing), which resets the running total to 0.

Press ENTER twice to end the application.

## Legal Stuff
Use of this software is covered under the MIT license, and in addition, the author assumes no liability for accuracy should

(MIT will announce that in their media, should this becomes the case).
